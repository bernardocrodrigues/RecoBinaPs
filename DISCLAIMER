All source placed at the pattern_mining/binaps/original subdirectory is authored by Fischer, J & Vreeken, J

The code is the replication package and source code for the neural autoencoder called BinaPs proposed by Fischer, J &
Vreeken, J in the paper 'Differentiable Pattern Set Mining' available at [3].

All code is committed as found on the package except from the content of binaps/Data/Genomes that was not included
here. This directory held 1.2GB of raw data for one of the author's experiments. This experiment is uninteresting in the
extension proposed by this repository.
